# DS assignment 4

In this assignment, I program for comparing the Huffman coding and the Arithmetic coding. 
Source code:
The Huffman coding:

The Arithmetic coding:

## What will show you when run this code
1. Enter the number of charactors.
2. Enter the charactors with its frequency.
3. Show the charactors' compressed code done by the Huffman coding.
4. Show the system execution time.
4. Show the charactors and its probability and interval.
5. Enter the text maken up by the charactors you entered before.
6. Show the result done by the Arithmetic coding.
7. Show the system execution time.
## Compile & Run
```sh
# Compile
g++ HW4.cpp -o main
# Run
./main
```
